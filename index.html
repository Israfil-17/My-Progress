    <h1>My Coding Journey Progress</h1>
    <p>I will try to code and document everything I am learning here in this website/webpage, with all the code and comments and tags and ways to use certain things etc. It'll be both a practice and a document to see how far I've come and commit it all to github for safe keeping, and perhaps share it to the world someday</p>
